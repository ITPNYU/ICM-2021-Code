## Mode of Instruction

This course will be offered entirely online. We will meet on Zoom at our regularly scheduled time to share homework and to discuss the week's topics. Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions. These are unprecedented times, and I'm happy to discuss how I can make the class work for each of you. 

## Class Recordings

All class lectures will be recorded to accommodate students who miss class. Recordings will not be shared publicly and will not be available after the semester ends. Please reach out to me if you do not feel comfortable being recorded.
